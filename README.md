# Part Breakouts

These part breakouts are general purpose and most do not belong
in their own dedicated repository.

# Prototyping

Most of these boards are designed to be quickly fabricated using a CNC mill (currently an Othermachine Othermill v2).

This means the boards/parts have been tested with:

* FR-1 substrate (will not survive extended rework/reflow)

* Usually built around wide trace/spacing rules for fast milling
  1/32 (usually) bit use.

Designs here try to minimize use of:

* Through-holes (a mill as of 2015 does not come with a plating bath)

* Vias

* Double sided designs (edge finding/registration makes things harder on 'go fast' prototypes)
