# Ring oscillator

A [ring oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_oscillator) that was used for a demo.

(Yes those little ears on the edges of the copper fill do get milled too. The board isn't all that big, so there isn't much waste.)

## Parts used:

* 3x SN74LVC1GU04DBVR

* 2x 2-pin headers (input, output and power)

## Assembly

The ICs can be soldered by hand using a one-leg tack method. Solder one leg, straighten the IC slightly (as necessary),
and solder an opposing leg. Solder the rest, and heat up the first leg to relieve any strain.

For long term use it's probably best to go with solder paste+hot air reflow, and a proper PCB.

---

Solder in the headers too, but be sure to mark which output is which (since there won't be any silkscreen).
